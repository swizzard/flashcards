# flashcards

## about

a pretty successful attempt at a vanilla js flashcards web app

does enough, for now

[`cards.mjs`](public/cards.mjs) exports `cards: Array<{front: string, back: string}>`; replace the contents while keeping the type and you've got your own flashcards app suitable for hosting on [netlify](https://netlify.com) or wherever
